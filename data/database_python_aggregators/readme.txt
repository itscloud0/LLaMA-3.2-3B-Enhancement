#These python files need to be downloaded onto your computer and then run in order to build the database file onto your computer (Mac/Linux).
Here is what you need to do (assuming you have the necessary libraries installed beforehand to perform the following:
* In the same directory as the files:
  - python3 -m venv venv
  - source venv/bin/activate
* Then you can run whichever file you choose:
  - python3 singularJSON.py
  - python3 singularANYlite.py
  - (THIS FILE IS 8GB) python3 singularANY.py
Libraries you probably need (install onto your computer or in the virtual environment-- venv):
* python / python3
* datasets
* requests
* theres probably more, but I don't remember :S just follow your error log and find out if any other libraries are missing, and install them.
